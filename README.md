## Overview
The purpose of this study is to analyze citibike usage in New York city to compare how we would start up our own similar business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results

In this bar chart, we can see the overall count of bikes that are being used during the time of day. Although New York is a city that never sleeps, usage decreases from 1AM to 5AM. This could also be due to the fact that people may be engaging in night time activities and it's not wise to bike while intoxicated, so they elect to ride a taxi home instead.

Here are two charts. In both, we can see that at around 5 or 6AM, trip durations remain the same. However, the second better depicts the staggering difference between the number of male users and female/unknown users. Male users practically double the number of both female and unknown users combined.

In this graph, we are able to further break down the most bikes rented by the hours and weekdays. We can see that stop times are heavier around 8AM and 6PM for the weekdays. This makes sense as those who are using the bikes to commute, may be done with their trip and dropping them off before heading to work. On the weekends, the bikes are generally used throughout the day. However, Saturday is showing to be heavier in the morning and lightening up throughout the day. This could be due to the fact that people are starting their activities earlier in the morning. On Sunday, the rentals remain around the same throughout the day from 10AM to 6PM. This may be because people prefer to stay home to prepare for the upcoming workweek.

We can compare this chart that is filtered to show unknown gender to the previous one. I really wanted to note how unknown users seem to be using bikes more on the weekends, although the chart above shows that overall usage was more common during the weekdays. What is causing this? Could it be that unknown users are not a fan of Citibike, and therefore not using it for everyday work commutes? This would be a good thing to note in further research before opening business in Des Moines.

In terms of location, it's also good to consider where to place bikes. This chart shows that the top starting locations are on the southern tip of the island. In the more suburban areas surrounding New York at the smaller dots, it seems that there are more female users, while the male users are concentrated at the popular points.

Finally, this chart breaks down the usage throughout the week based on gender and usertype. It looks like across genders, subscribers are more likely to be making trips. This could be due to the fact that these users subscribed because they do not have another form of transformation, or they rely on citibike as they have already invested in the product. It makes sense that subscribers are more likely to use the bikes for their everyday commutes as it is more efficient for their wallets. However, it is interesting to note that across all genders amongst subscribers, there seems to be less usage on Wednesday's. It would be good to note what is causing this as it is still a workday.

## Summary

Overall, it was a good idea to research CitiBike usage in New York City. We got a good idea of peak times and days, as well as gender breakup. However, it's important to note that Des Moines is a very different from New York City. 

For further analysis, we need to do research on how weather affects Citibike (it definitely snows in New York!) to know how it would affect profits in the colder months. 

Additionally, it would be good to understand what is affecting Unknown users to differ from the majority male/female specified users. Is it something the company has done to make them not favor Citibike? What can our company do differently that would make it more inclusive? More studies should be done on gender breakdown usage, as well as locations so that we have a better understanding of where to place our bikes since Des Moines does not have as many major landmarks as New York City.
